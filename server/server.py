"""
version 0.2
Refactored to use async redis (aioredis) as cache for objects instead of managing them in dictionaries.
To keep better track of instances the Pydantic models (Room/Player) are recreated from the cache when needed, updated and then
serialized and stored in the cache for when next needed.
See utils.py for redis funcs.
